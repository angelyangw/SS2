Project Special Subject 2

Requirements:
- a socket based client-server application
- the client must send strings to the server and server must respond
- a RS485 is connected to the server via a serial connection 
- the client must be able to input commands to the RS485 and control the device attached to it (in this case, a red LED)
- the client must communicate with each DO(digital output) of the RS485 separately
- a simple to use GUI for the app

Progress:
- the client-server-RS485 communication is established
- the GUI is done
- the client can turn on/off all DOs or send a string from the keyboard to the RS485

What's next:
- finding a solution to separately controlling the DOs
- maybe improving the GUI ?!
